# Sinc

_*S*inc *I*s *N*ot *C*onvoluted_

Sinc is intended as a way to synchronize, peer-to-peer, all data between
devices. Spiritually, it is inspired by [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).

However, unlike _syncthing_, it exposes ways to transfer data, with plugins
handling specific data. Furthermore, it uses a multitude of discovery methods
to find other peers.
